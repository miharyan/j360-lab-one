<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="intro">Soekarno Kusnasosro or commonly known as Bung (bung, &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; or &ldquo;comrade&rdquo;) Karno was the first president of Indonesia from 1945 to 1967. On 17th of August 1945, Soekarno and Muhammad Hatta lead the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands. Before he proclaimed the independence, Soekarno stumbled trough many things. The Dutch arrested Kusnasosro twice because he formed a Nationalist Party of Indonesia. He also got exiled to Flores and Sumatra (new Bengkulu) for almost ten years.</p>
<p>Soekarno graduated with civil engineering major from Technische Hoge School (ITB) in Bandung, 1925. However, he realized that his true calling is in oratory and politics. Therefore, with his ability in mastering several languages including, Sundanese, Javanese, Balinese, modern Indonesian, Arabic, Dutch, German, French, English, and Japanese, Soekarno can achieve his dream to declare the independence of Indonesia.</p>
